            The building performance was the final project given at the beginning of Carnegie Mellon University's 2017 Freshman spring semester. The project focused on the movements and motions of a given utensil. The utensil’s movements were first observed, then translated/abstracted into 2D draftings on vellum. The drawings were, again, abstracted into two different sections and finally transformed into 3D wooden models using minimal glue and effective joinery.

            &nbsp;
        <p>
            After careful measurements and survey of the functions and idea of an iron, an "object drawing" was created, mimicking the horizontal movement of an iron as well as fully displaying different elevations and sections. This was done by the overlapping of elevations at the locations of the section cuts.
        </p>

            <div class="images"><img src="images/buildingperformance_object.jpg" alt="BuildingPerformanceObject" width=700px>
            </div>
            &nbsp;
        <p>
            Utilizing various clips of the movements of the iron, a "motion drawing" was then drafted. The drawing consists of three major elements: the movement of the arm, the movement of the object, and the movement of the subject. The movement of the arm is expressed by the simple lines that branch from the pivot circle. The movement of the object is clearly depicted by the major horizontal figure as well as the curving figure. Finally, the movement of the subject is exhibited by the vertical lines drawn in gradients--an abstraction of wrinkles on clothing.

            The tools implemented into the model's design are an iron and a potato peeler. The design itself was inspired by the action verb “sliding”, as both of the utensils had a major motif of sliding.

            The model was created through the bent lamination of poplar wood on a ashwood base with piano wire "pins". After bandsawing a plank of poplar wood into approximately 1/8" strips of wood, the strips were sent through the planer to "sand" down the wood into 1/16" piecess. The strips were then drumsanded down enough to be bent, then glued into 4-8 piece thick "ribbons" and clamped down onto molds. The dry ribbons were then sanded down to 1" wide strips to fit the original design.
        </p>

            &nbsp;
        <p>
            The final model features a heavy base as well as the light and airy ribbons to highlight the difference in weight and structure of the iron and the potato peeler.
