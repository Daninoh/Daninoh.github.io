            The cube house is the final project given at the end of Carnegie Mellon University’s Freshman fall semester. The prompt given was to design a wedding pavilion and a site plan housing the pavilion. The 80'x80' pavilion, in theory, would be located along Lake Erie, thus allowing the incorporation of water features. The 20'x20' cube pavilion would then have to be designed in accordance to various spatial and environmental circumstances, such as the sunpath.

        <p>
            Using three inital planes that were constantly tweaked, a cube was constructed in which the three planes were housed in. Holes were then cut out of the cube, following the spatial values created by the planes. Using this cube and the same theories as how the cube was created, the site was then created. Throughout the design process, the students were encouraged to incorporate small details such as golden rectangles and squares, and instructed to focus on experiential "moments". The plan, section, elevation, sectional perspective, and sectional axonometric drawings were finally drafted and hand-shaded on 23"x29" 1-ply Strathmore® paper.

            This final design portrayed the idea of symmetry and sense of an encased private space against a public space. The following wooden model was created on a 20"x20" platform and the basswood pavilion was constructed to be taken apart and lifted for acess to a more up-close inspection of the spaces formed by the planes.
