				<p>
					Career World Explorer is an interactive game for students in eighth grade to gain exposure to niche career paths across different disciplines. Traditional career day events are limited to generic and well known careers, use the instructor or school’s immediate personal connections as speakers for the students, and rely on text-based assessments. Career World Explorer uses role-playing mechanics, scaffolding through in-game mentorship and exposure to careers via “career worlds” to inspire and engage our target age group to see themselves in positions outside of the well-trodden paths of doctors, engineers and lawyers. We conducted multiple interviews with three eighth grade teachers to refine our educational goals, assessments and storyboard design. Our final prototype builds upon their feedback and the lessons learned from our iterative process.

				<p>
					Much of the project focuses on both avenues of motivation (intrinsic motivators, extrinsic motivators). Intrinsic motivation becomes apparent both when the learner enjoys playing games and if the learner desires to discover potential careers. Users motivated intrinsically are able to utilize the game to their own terms. Moreover, with proper facilitation, this game may also become a great substitute to “career days”, as remote learning and interaction becomes more and more prominent due to the pandemic. We want to expose the students to the variety of careers that exist in the broader world, connect their academic learning with world building, and enable students to project themselves into any of these careers.

				<h3 class="subtitle">the game</h3>
				<p>
					We created a number of prototypes throughout the project. We started with low-fidelity sketch prototypes, from which the “career world”, narrative and skill tree concepts emerged, followed by multiple storyboards to refine the interaction. You can find a deeper description of the game in the <a href="../documents/careerexplorer_report.pdf">final report</a>.

				<h3 class="subtitle">assessment</h3>
				<p>
					We imagine the implementation of a pre-test to gauge the students' current interests in future careers, their desired career path, and the connection they believe is between the course work and their cuture. This would be followed up with formative assessments throughout the game asking their interests in a newly found career, their summary of what the career is about, and a question they might have about that career. They would also complete a short summative assessment asking which career was their favorite and if they can see themselves in the field. Lastly, we imagined a post-test to re-examine their unstanding of their desired careers and how they might get to it.
