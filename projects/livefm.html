				<h3>project synopsis</h3>
				<p>
					live.fm is an app that enables live performers to perform, collaborate, and gain recognition from their loss of live music during the pandemic.

				<h3 class="subtitle">ecosystem map</h3>
				<p>
					The ecosystem map was useful in investigating questions of what would motivate users to use this app and how they would feel when they are using it. We used the ecosystem chart to find out what we each knew on the topic, and figure out what areas needed more research, and then highlight those areas of assumptions. For example, we lacked information concerning how music producers used social media to discover new talents or what emotions the users would feel when experiencing our app.
					<br><br>
					This process has helped us to visualize our initial steps and learn thoroughly about app ideas. At this stage, we were unsure of the direction we were heading in so it was helpful to think about what our exact expectations were and to narrow down our target audience. Through this process, we found out what areas needed more research and the kind of people we need to interview in order to further direct our app intentions.

				<h3 class="subtitle">stakeholder interviews</h3>
				<p>
					Each member of the team interviewed a different stakeholder. In total, we interviewed four individuals spanning from social media creators, social media consumers, and a singer.
					<br><br>
					We noticed that different audiences reacted differently to our app idea. Average social media users were interested to hear about the app but claimed that because they were not musically inclined, they would not be motivated to use it or want to perform in front of an audience. Meanwhile, the singer, seemed intrigued by the collaborative aspect and saw it as a platform that could showcase her skills. In general both the content creator and singer viewed social media as an entertaining way to express themselves and as a creative outlet rather than as a medium for potential career development. 
					<br><br>
					Through our interviews we learned new information that helped us develop our app idea. We found  it interesting to see how different users reacted to social media. For example, one of the social media users project that they felt anxious when they went through certain platforms so creating a relaxed environment through out platform became an important goal in our design process. It also became an important design decision for us to think about how users could begin to use this app to become inspired and motivated to create with other people.

				<h3 class="subtitle">storyboarding</h3>
				<p>
					We tackled three scenarios that explained different types of targeted users. We focused on collaborative, casual, and discovering aspects and came up with three “how might we” questions to help guide our app motivations. Those questions were: “How might we help people discover new artists?”, “How might we enable collaborative music?” and “How might we get casual users to create new music?”

				<h3 class="subtitle">lo-fi wireframing</h3>
				<p>
					At this stage, we focused mostly on the usability and functional aspects of our digital product, and having an efficient information architecture. To do this, we decided the main features of the app and designed high-level prototypes for only those screens. During this process, we discussed how we could create a natural progression that was intuitive to users, and figured out the features that were unique to our app.

				<h3 class="subtitle">usability tests</h3>
				<p>
					We were originally doubtful of giving out the test on our lo-fi prototypes, however, it still allowed us to see new perspectives and gave us an idea of how it is to experience our product with fresh eyes. For example during the usability test, it was mentioned that the term “battles” can be confusing and was suggested to change the term into “Jam Sessions” for more clarity. Although we ended up keeping the term “battles,” we decided to use icons to help guide the users. Also another thing that we noticed was that the participants often knew how to use our product based on their previous experience with existing social media designs. For example, the profile and swiping features were easily recognized by all the users.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<h3 class="subtitle">mid-fi prototype</h3>
				<p>
					We focused on finalizing the aesthetic direction of the screens through being more detailed and meticulous towards the design features and grid layout. These screens use the same path as the designed wireframe.

			<div class="col-md-12">
				<h3 class="subtitle">hi-fi prototype</h3>
				<p>
					We also created a full prototype with detailed interactions on Figma. This included a pause screen for the discover feature, an interactive onboarding screen, and a swiping feature for the battle matching screen. This prototype can be found and experienced through this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/m7Stqjj6j3FQDs9YrzOnxr/Hi-Fi-Prototype?node-id=6%3A2236&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=6%3A2236&hide-ui=1">Figma link</a>.
