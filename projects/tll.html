					What I’ve done for this course this week…
					<br>(1) Read <i>Applying Psychological Science to Higher Education: Key Findings and Open Questions</i> (Moulton 2014)
					<br>(2) Coded and set up my ePortfolio on my personal website
					<br>(3) Settled on my top choice of projects for the practicum
				</p><br>
				<h4><b>reading thoughts...</b></h4><br>
				<p>
					I always felt that there was <i>something</i> missing in my academic experiences learning about education and educational technologies. In his paper, Moulton describes the challenges that exist in the marriage between existing research and the practice of education. At first, I was reminded of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/pdf/klahr/PDFs/Instructional%20Complexity.pdf">Koedinger, Booth, & Klahr (2013)</a> where they emphasize the complexities of learning science and develop a list of learning principles, but the more I read, the more I realized the focus was on finding the gaps in the bridge between practice and theory. It was refreshing to read something written about learning principles that isn’t obscure and verbose and really getting down to the essential (and extremely blunt) descriptions of the findings. 
				</p><br>		
				<p>
					Beyond the summaries of the existing research, I found the <i>Myths and Misconceptions</i> section to be the most evocative. Namely that (1) “there is no evidence that teachers should design instruction based on students’ learning styles,” (2) “the concept of ‘far transfer’, or the doctrine of formal discipline&mdash;is highly suspect,” (3) “with some exceptions for elementary and special education, neuroscience adds very little value to our practical understanding of learning and teaching,” and (4) “as indirect measures of learning, student ratings of instruction are neither worthless nor particularly useful.”
				</p><br>
				<p>
					Furthermore, I felt validated by the open questions and gaps Moulton points out, because many of these were the same questions I’ve been thinking about. These questions spanned from thinking about how we assess learners in different contexts to how we integrate evidence-based practices in classrooms and beyond to the trade-offs of having crammable lecture videos. All in all, I thought this paper provided a fantastic summary of known principles as well as a clear framework of potential research questions for educational researchers, educators, and learning designers. 
				</p><br>
				<h4><b>my eportfolio</b></h4><br>
				<p>
					I spent a couple of hours setting up my ePortfolio for the Teaching and Learning Lab Practicum. This was a fun little design exercise, thinking about the most accessible format for the page. All in all, I’m happy with the current design, but open to future changes! 
				</p><br>
				<img class="img-fluid" alt="TLL Portfolio Screenshot" src="../img/tll/webdesign.png"><br><br>
				<h4><b>project choice</b></h4><br>
				<p>
					Currently, I am very interested in both the <b>Anti-Racist Teaching Resources</b> project and the <b>Digital “Homepage” for New Online Program</b> project. Both of these projects seem to complement my current skillset, hopefully allowing me to participate and contribute to the team to a professional degree. After speaking with Bill, I am a bit more drawn towards the latter project, due to its early project scope and the potential for a lot more design problem thinking.

				<a href="#"><h3 class="subtitle">&lt;&lt;</a>&nbsp; reflection week 4 [02/18/22]</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					What I’ve done for this course this week…
					<br>(1) Had my first meeting with Katherine and Bernard about the <b>Anti-Racist Teaching and Advising (ARTA)</b> Resources!
					<br>(2) [Briefly] learned about the history of learning design and some approaches to LD
					<br>(3) Connected the readings to my own undergraduate experience studying architecture
				</p><br>
				<h4><b>anti-racist teaching and adivising resources</b></h4><br>
				<p>
					<i>Why am I motivated to work on the ARTA resources?</i>
				</p><br>
				<p>
					Having taken several courses on equity and accessible design throughout my higher-ed experience, I am very hopeful to
					work on a DEIB initiative in a professional context. I am hoping to apply my own experiences and my learned knowledge to
					create some kind of platform that can accessibly educate individuals at HGSE (and more).
				</p><br>
				<p>
					One of the primary questions I had about this initiative was if it was a mandatory training program for HGSE educators,
					or if it was more of a supplementary resource. If it were up to me… it’d be mandatory! However, the answer to this
					question will heavily affect how I will plan on approaching this project.
				</p><br>
				<p>
					Beyond the meeting, I looked into several different DEIB resources at other universities including resources from
					Columbia University CTL, Wheaton College, University of Michigan, and Brown University. I’m excited to dive deeper to
					find more evocative and effective precedents that we might be able to bring into the HGSE community.
				</p><br>
				<h4><b>history of learning design</b></h4><br>
				<p>
					I was a bit curious about the differences between IDEO/Stanford d.school’s design process and the 5D Framework. I found
					that Discover correlated to Empathize and Define, Design to Ideate, Develop to Prototype, Deliver to Test, and Debrief
					to Assess. Perhaps there is a difference, but at first glance, I couldn’t tell. I was also very fascinated by the brief
					lesson on the history of learning design! I think this was the first time I have been exposed to this knowledge (in
					other courses I’ve heard about the history of multimedia and such, but not so much the theoretical basis of learning
					design). It was surprising to hear how late learning design actually entered the academic circle.
				</p><br>
				<h4><b>architecture & essential questions</b></h4><br>
				<p>
					I studied architecture for my undergraduate degree, and recently I was talking to one of my undergraduate friends about
					what was wrong with architectural pedagogy. I think we came to an understanding that our education never questioned,
					"why do we need to study architecture? What is the point of architecture for the public, beyond "creating beautiful
					experiences? What can architecture do?" We can learn about the environmental and social effects of architecture, but
					without the underpinning framing of what architecture does for people, there becomes a focus on the built environment,
					rather than the people we design for.

				<br>
				<p>
					What I’ve done for this course this week…
					<br>(1) Second meeting with the team, discussing our initial interests and brainstorming initial ideas for our work
					<br>(2) Thought about the idea of <i>nuance</i> in relation to designing for disability, for learners, and broader design thinking.
				</p><br>
				<h4><b>meeting reflection and summary</b></h4><br>
				<p>
					Over the past week, I have been thinking about the scope and frame of this project. With a very loose guideline and
					understanding of the ARTA initiative, I answered four key questions to help set our design problem: (1) Who are my
					learners?, (2) What do I want learners to experience and do?, (3) What are some inspirational models and precedents we
					can look at?, and (4) Who do we need to reach out to for more guidance and what else do I need to know?
				</p><br>
				<p>
					<i>(1) Who are my learners?</i><br>
					If we can turn this into a mandatory training program, I would like to create a project that teaches all faculty at
					HGSE. However, if that is out of the scope, I am also interested in creating a platform for faculty who either get
					referred to these resources or are interested in learning more about the ARTA framework.
				</p><br>
				<p>
					<i>(2) What do I want learners to experience and do?</i><br>
					I’m hoping that we can tackle the process of learning to unlearn. With this specific project, I want to see if we can
					design a tool that informs faculty in their interpersonal communities and classrooms. Perhaps this includes interactive
					training? In the end, I want to create a platform that the faculty at HGSE will not be overwhelmed with, but also
					transformative to their thinking, teaching, and curriculum.
				</p><br>
				<p>
					<i>(3) What are some inspirational models and precedents we can look at?</i><br>
					I thought about it in three different scopes, what’s not working, what looks effective, and what looks interesting. A
					few resource collections I have found did not work due to the sheer amount of text and hyperlinks on a single page
					(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.educause.edu/about/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/resources">EduCause</a>, <a
					target="_blank"
					href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/effective-teaching-anti-racist-teaching">Brown
					University</a>). However, resources with a <a target="_blank"
					href="https://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/special-projects-initiatives/center-for-collaborative-teaching-and-learning/anti-racist-educator/">focus
					on hierarchy</a> or an innovative solution through a <a target="_blank"
					href="https://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/special-projects-initiatives/center-for-collaborative-teaching-and-learning/anti-racist-educator/">dedicated
					curriculum</a> seemed like more effective methods of teaching faculty. Lastly, I found a VR project called <a target="_blank"
					href="https://cogburnresearchgroup.socialwork.columbia.edu/research-projects/1000-cut-journey">1,000 Cut
					Journey</a> from Columbia University that seemed very interesting. I am interested in seeing if there are more anti-racist
					initiatives that are as interactive and engaging as this!
				</p><br>
				<p>
					<i>(4) Who do we need to reach out to for more guidance and what else do I need to know?</i><br>
					I would love some more precedent models and projects to work off of. If we knew of any interesting media projects like
					the 1,000 Cut Journey, that would be phenomenal (riffing off of Bernard’s comment, maybe a chatbot already exists as a
					precedent?).<br><br>

					I would also love to hold a conversation with any faculty who is currently working in DEIB, right now (the first people
					that come to mind are Dr. Josephine Kim and Dr. Gretchen Brion-Meisels, but I’m open to anyone!). I want a better
					framework to work with, instead of trying to create something blindly. What are some issues faculty are seeing with
					current DEIB initiatives? What resources are people exposed to and what are their means of access?
				</p><br>
				<p>
					<i>Currently, Bern and I are beginning to think about a collaborative project, incorporating some of the features of the
					precedent project we have looked into – in order to create an engaging, interactive platform with reduced cognitive
					load.</i>
				</p><br>
				<h4><b>nuance in design</b></h4><br>
				<p>
					This week had a lot of ‘big idea’ overlap between all of my courses and work. Specifically, in between thinking about
					designing spaces and objects for disabled folks (with <a target="_blank" href="https://sarahendren.com/">Sara Hendren</a> in her amazing course, Investigating Normal), to
					designing for children (with Mitch Resnick in Learning Creative Learning and my teaching position with Bertrand
					Schneider), to designing for learners–there was a floating term that seemed to encapsulate my week, nuance.
				</p><br>
				<p>
					In response to my question to last week, where I asked if there is a difference between the 5D ‘waterfall’ flow and the
					IDEO design thinking ‘recipe,’ while it isn’t quite highlighted in the actual simplified depictions, the differences
					lies in the nuances between designing for a general user base and designing for specific learners.
				</p><br>
				<p>
					As designers, we have to be aware of the unique affordances of each of our clients and users. Just as the needs and pain
					points of disabled individuals are different from children, we have to be aware of the nuances between each individual
					within that subcategory. While design thinking often aims to create a solution through a hypothetical persona generated
					from a selected group of people, I challenge this idea and imagine a design process that incorporates an individualized
					solution through co-design. One amazing precedent we discussed is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adaptivedesign.org/">ADA (Adaptive Design Association)</a>, where they
					design furniture and other artifacts through one-on-one, personal customization with affordable materials. This personal
					relationship between the designer and user results in a product where the actual end user is a part of the ideation
					process. I begin to wonder if I could think about incorporating this into the ARTA initiative…
